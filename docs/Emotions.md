# 💖 Emotion-Driven Design – Keeping College Students Hooked (Healthily)

> “People will forget what you said, but they will never forget how you made them feel.” – Maya Angelou

Unistory is more than a platform. It's a **daily emotional companion** for college students. By applying **emotion-centered design**, we create a space that feels safe, rewarding, and habit-forming — without manipulation.

## 🌈 Emotional Design Levels (Don Norman's Model)

| Level | Description | Design Application |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Visceral** | Immediate look & feel | Aesthetic appeal, soothing colors, microanimations |
| **Behavioral** | Function satisfaction | Smooth interactions, clear CTA, feedback |
| **Reflective** | Self-image & meaning | Journaling, streaks, social reflection features |

---

## 🎯 Emotional Goals of Unistory

| Emotional State | Design Strategy |

## 🧠 Triggers for Emotional Engagement

### ✅ Positive Emotions We Reinforce

- Curiosity → content discoverability, explore sections
- Pride → badges, achievements, profile highlights
- Gratitude → journaling, appreciation prompts
- Humor → memes, confession wall, real-life stories
- Awe → student creations (design, music, innovation)
- Inspiration → uplifting stories, goals board, progress chart

### 🚫 Negative Emotions We Avoid or Regulate

- FOMO → no follower counts, non-algorithmic feed
- Social comparison → private progress, no “like” obsession
- Anxiety → delay-based DM reading, no read receipts by default
- Rejection → soft rejections, opt-in visibility
- Overwhelm → progressive onboarding, modular dashboard

## 📲 Emotional UX Patterns

### 1. **Mood-Aware Interface**
- Ask: “How are you feeling today?” → subtle color UI shifts
- Darker tones on tired days, brighter on high-energy days

### 2. **Gratitude & Wins Popups**
- Small celebratory popups: “You helped 4 people today” or “Nice journal streak!”

### 3. **Reflection-Driven Journaling**
- “What was one small win today?”
- “What’s something you’re proud of recently?”
- “Who’s someone you appreciated this week?”

### 4. **Microinteractions that Feel Human**
- Heartbeat-like bounce on success
- Custom emoji reactions for campus culture
- Haptic feedback and vibrations (mobile)

### 5. **Safe Spaces for Vulnerability**
- Confession wall: anonymous, moderated, supportive
- Trigger warnings and opt-in blur overlays
- “Send kindness” button → anonymously send encouragements

## 🎮 Gamification for Emotional Drive (Not Addiction)

| Feature | Emotion Triggered |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Streaks** (journaling, buddy chat) | Commitment, consistency |
| **Missions** (weekly creative/social prompts) | Intrinsic reward, purpose |
| **Badges** (kindness, helpfulness, expression) | Pride, identity |
| **Leveling up profile** | Personal growth, ownership |
| **Reflection timeline** | Meaning, nostalgia |

---

## 🎨 Visual Emotional Language

- **Colors**: Teal (trust), Lilac (creativity), Warm Peach (support)
- **Typography**: Rounded, friendly sans-serif (Inter or Plus Jakarta)
- **Imagery**: Diverse, real, relatable — not stocky or aspirational
- **Icons**: Lucide-styled, outlined, expressive but clean

---

## 🧪 A/B Test Ideas (Emotion Metrics)

- Test different **onboarding tone**: friendly vs. mission-driven
- Compare **gratitude prompts** vs. motivational prompts in journaling
- Measure **retention** impact of “anonymous kindness” features
- Track mood uplift after completing daily reflections

---
